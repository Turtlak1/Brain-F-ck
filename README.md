<h1>Brain-Fuck Interpreter</h1>

<p>
Brain F*ck Interpreter in python, is fast and easy to use. 
Every thing is running in the terminal. 
I am sorry that I don´t use comments in the source code.
</p>

<h2>It´s easy to use</h2>

<p>
Every thing is in the help, just run the program without any extra commands or use <code>-h</code> and it display help or something like this <br><br>

```

<h2>Debugging is not good</h2>

<p>
Debugging with this interpreter is not good. You're probably wondering why. Because it is Brain F*ck you can not debug it without just printing the array or something like this. This interpreter just print the array.

<h2>Why I do this</h2>

<p>Because I don´t know what to do an thats why.</p>
